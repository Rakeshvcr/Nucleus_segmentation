# Nucleus_segmentation

The nucleus is an organelle found in most eukaryotic cells, The primary functions of the nucleus are to store the cellâ€™s DNA, maintain its integrity, and facilitate its transcription and replication. The researcher found a connection between the shape of the nucleus and human disease states such as cancer. The size and shape of the nucleus of a cancer cell are often abnormal. Typically, the nucleus of a cancer cell is larger and darker than that of a normal cell and its size can vary greatly. Methods for assessing nuclear size and shape typically involve identifying the nucleus via traditional image segmentation approaches. Here we demonstrate a deep learning approach for the identification and segmentation of nuclei from images of cells.

## U-Net Model 

In U-Net there are a large number of feature channels in the upsampling part, which allow the network to propagate context information to higher resolution layers. As a consequence, the expansive path is more or less symmetric to the contracting part, and yields a u-shaped architecture.
